# Global-Terrorism-Data-Visualization
My contribution to a group project on Global Terrorism data covering 1970 - 2017. I created an interactive Shiny Dashboard using R. 

I uploaded a trimmed dataset used for the project. The original dataset could be found on Kaggel at https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd. 

The TylerBoudart_ShinyDataFrames file is the R File I used to create the different dataframes used on the Shiny Dashboard. 

The TylerBoudart_app file is the R File that runs the Shiny Dashboard. 

Don't hestitate to email me at tlboudart@gmail.com if you have any comments, questions, or suggestions.
