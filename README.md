# Global-Terrorism-Data-Visualization
I completed a group project in my data visualization course using Global Terrorism data covering 1970 - 2017. My contribution to the project was creating an interactive Shiny Dashboard using R. The dashboard and its graphs were code solely by me using ggplot2 and thinking about the data, user, and task. I created seven subsets of the main data frame to allow the user to choose between displaying seven different qualitative attributes of interest. The user can select a minimum number of fatalities for a class to be displayed in the graphs and animate through the years. The dashboard allows the user to examine the trends of different qualitative attributes like terrorist organizations, target types, attack types, and more, to see how they change over time or are related to each other in specific years. I also have experience coding other types of graphs in R and using Tableau.

I uploaded a trimmed dataset used for the project. The original dataset could be found on Kaggel at https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd. 

The TylerBoudart_ShinyDataFrames file is the R File I used to create the different dataframes used on the Shiny Dashboard. 

The TylerBoudart_app file is the R File that runs the Shiny Dashboard.
